# 👋 Hi, I'm Mihika!

🔭 I'm currently studying **Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of California, Davis**. I love coding and exploring the intricacies of algorithms and data structures. My passion for technology extends beyond the classroom; I'm always eager to take on challenging projects and immerse myself in hands-on learning experiences. From developing full-stack applications to delving deep into machine learning models, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what I know and continuously expanding my technical horizons.
